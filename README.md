# CW_CarLights
An Arduino library to send and receive commands to control lights on an RC car/robot via I2C. This library was written for the main robot 'brain' so send commands to the 'light controller'. In my case the main brain was a an Arduino Uno, and the light controller was a small Trinket Pro.

This library has both a send and a receive part.
